Task: Implement a User Authentication System

Requirements:
Our project currently lacks user authentication, and it's crucial to secure certain parts of 
the application. Your task is to implement a user authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) 
and integrate it into both the front-end (React) and back-end (Node.js and Express).

Steps:

1. Back-End: Node.js and Express

- Create API routes for user registration, login, and logout.
- Use a MongoDB database to store user information such as username, email, and hashed passwords.
- Implement JWT for token-based authentication. Users should receive a token upon successful login.

2. Front-End: React

- Create UI components for user registration, login, and logout.
- Implement form validations for registration and login forms.
- Use React Context or Redux to manage user authentication state globally.
- Ensure that components are conditionally rendered based on the user's authentication status.

3. Integration: Connecting Front-End and Back-End

- Make API calls from the React application to register, log in, and log out users.
- Store the JWT token securely on the client side (consider using secure HTTP-only cookies).
- Implement middleware on the server side to verify the authenticity of incoming requests.

4. Bonus Points:

- Add features like password reset and email verification.
- Enhance the UI with feedback messages for successful and unsuccessful authentication attempts.
- Implement role-based access control if our project requires different levels of access for users.

# Guidelines:

1. Collaborate with other team members to clarify any doubts or seek assistance.
2. Make use of best practices for security, code structure, and documentation.
3. Regularly commit your code to our version control system (Git) and create meaningful commit messages.
4. Keep me updated on your progress and feel free to schedule regular checkpoints for feedback.

This task encompasses both front-end and back-end development, providing a comprehensive learning experience. 
If you encounter any challenges or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Good luck, and I look forward 
to seeing your implementation!
